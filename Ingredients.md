The ingredients that are needed to make the creation of the Chick-Fil-A spicy chicken sandwhich possible is listed below
    1: A top bun for the top of the sandwhich
    2: A bottom bun for the bottom of the sandwhich
    3: (optional) Pickles on top of the bottom bun of the sandwhich. I don't prefer it
    4: mayoniase or ranch. Whichever one you prefer the most to make sure your tastebuds are sastisfied!
